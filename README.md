## PSD-to-HTML: Engine Labs Homepage
Difficulty Level: Easy  
Technologies/skills used: HTML, CSS  

### Task
+ Turn the index.html file into the Engine Labs homepage
+ Match the Engine Labs mockup (psd or jpg) as closely as you can

### Assets
* Images for the icons and background have been provided for you in the `/img` folder
* Each section spans the width of the page (100%) and has a more narrow (960px), centered subsection where the content goes

### Tips
* Don't forget to declare your site's CSS file in the header
* Before you start to code, look over the requirements and quickly sketch an approach

#### Keep it simple
* Try this without using a grid framework like Skeleton or Bootstrap.
* Once you feel confident hand-coding, investigate a grid framework and see how much time it saves you.

#### Create structure systematically
* Start building the page from the top and continue down
* Break the page into vertically-stacking sections--for example, create header, hero image, quote, features, etc 

#### Use classes effectively
* Come up with class names that describe the function of a particular element rather than describing the content inside it. 
* Creating functional classes lets you style elements quickly when they need to serve a common purpose.
* For instance, for a div that needs to be noticable, naming it `.callout` rather than `.side-of-story-color-background-designer-quote` means you don't have to restrict the content inside to quotations from designers--and you can easily use the class name elsewhere in the site. 

### Resources
* Absolute positioning and floats.
* [Sprite Cow](http://www.spritecow.com/): working with css and sprite images
* Reseting styles: Use a `reset.css` for cross-browser harmony. [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and [YUI](http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.10.1/build/cssreset/cssreset-min.css) both have reset files.
